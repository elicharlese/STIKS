# Backend Development Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide the development of a robust, production-ready backend for your STIKS application, ensuring seamless integration with your React/Next.js frontend, Supabase, and Solana blockchain via Rust SDK. It covers all major features and logic inferred from your current frontend components and project structure.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] **Monorepo/Repo Structure**: Organize backend and frontend codebases (monorepo or separate repos as needed).
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Define and securely manage all required environment variables (API keys, DB URLs, secrets, etc.).
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, building, and deploying backend (and frontend) to Vercel.
- [ ] **Production Build**: Ensure backend is built and tested for production, with optimized Dockerfile or Vercel serverless functions.

## 2. API Design & Integration
- [ ] **REST/GraphQL API**: Design endpoints for all frontend data needs (products, portfolios, analytics, user accounts, etc.).
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Use OpenAPI/Swagger or GraphQL schema docs for all endpoints.
- [ ] **TypeScript Types**: Share types/interfaces between backend and frontend for type safety.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Integrate Supabase Auth (wallet-based login, JWT, session management).
- [ ] **Authorization**: Role-based access control for sensitive endpoints (admin, user, etc.).
- [ ] **Rate Limiting & Security**: Implement rate limiting, input validation, and security headers.

## 3. Database & Storage (Supabase)
- [ ] **Schema Design**: Model all entities (Users, Products, Portfolios, Transactions, Analytics, etc.) in Supabase/Postgres.
- [ ] **Migrations**: Use migration tools for schema changes.
- [ ] **Row-Level Security**: Enforce RLS policies for user data isolation.
- [ ] **Realtime/Subscriptions**: Enable Supabase realtime for live updates (e.g., portfolio changes, market data).
- [ ] **File Storage**: Use Supabase Storage for user-uploaded files or documents if needed.

## 4. Blockchain Integration (Solana via Rust SDK)
- [ ] **Rust Microservice**: Build a Rust service (or serverless function) using Solana SDK for blockchain operations (minting, transfers, product creation, etc.).
- [ ] **API Bridge**: Expose Rust service via HTTP/gRPC endpoints callable from the Next.js API routes.
- [ ] **Wallet Connect**: Support wallet connection and transaction signing from frontend (via Solana wallet adapters).
- [ ] **On-chain Data Sync**: Sync on-chain data (balances, transactions, product states) with Supabase for fast frontend queries.
- [ ] **Security**: Validate all blockchain interactions, prevent replay attacks, and handle errors gracefully.

## 5. Feature-Specific Logic
### Products (CDOs, STIK PAKS, etc.)
- [ ] CRUD endpoints for products, including metadata, pricing, and status.
- [ ] Blockchain minting/creation for new products (via Rust service).
- [ ] Product analytics aggregation (performance, risk, etc.).

### Portfolio Management
- [ ] Endpoints for creating, updating, and fetching user portfolios.
- [ ] Asset allocation logic (tranches, STIK PAKS, etc.).
- [ ] Performance metrics calculation (yield, drawdown, etc.).
- [ ] Transaction history and recent activity endpoints.

### Analytics & Market Data
- [ ] Integrate with external APIs for market prices (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.).
- [ ] Aggregate and cache analytics for dashboard performance.
- [ ] Expose endpoints for charts, stats, and market overview.

### User & Account Management
- [ ] User registration/login via wallet (Supabase Auth).
- [ ] Profile endpoints (settings, preferences, etc.).
- [ ] Terms acceptance and compliance tracking.

### Governance & Docs
- [ ] Endpoints for governance proposals, voting, and results.
- [ ] Documentation and help content delivery (static or dynamic).

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for all backend logic (TypeScript and Rust).
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical user flows (wallet connect, product purchase, etc.).
- [ ] Mock blockchain and Supabase for CI tests.

## 7. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Logging (structured, error, and audit logs).
- [ ] Metrics and health checks for all services.
- [ ] Alerting for failures or suspicious activity.

## 8. Deployment
- [ ] Automated deployment to Vercel (frontend and backend/serverless functions).
- [ ] Rust microservice deployed as a serverless function or container (Vercel, Fly.io, or similar).
- [ ] Post-deploy smoke tests.
- [ ] Production environment verification (API, DB, blockchain connectivity).

## 9. Documentation
- [ ] Update README with backend setup, API usage, and deployment instructions.
- [ ] Document all environment variables and secrets.
- [ ] Architecture diagram (optional but recommended).

---

**Final Step:**
- [ ] Tag a production release, push to GitHub, and verify deployment on Vercel.

_This checklist should be updated as new features/components are added to the frontend or as backend requirements evolve._
